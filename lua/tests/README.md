# Testing lua libs

The 3 directories :

- busted_specs : contains some verified/useful test (works fine) with the lib busted (https://olivinelabs.com/busted/)
- benchmark_tests : contains tests to compare speed of different libs
- manual_tests : all old/unstable tests file. Need to convert into busted test
